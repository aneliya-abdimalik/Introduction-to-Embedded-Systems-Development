# Introduction-to-Embedded-Systems-Development
Three key projects showcasing interrupt-driven I/O, round-robin scheduling, ADC and USART communication, and real-time control on the PIC18F8722.

## Projects Overview

1. **Round-Robin LED Sequencer** (`hw1`)
   - Implement a round-robin scheduler on the PIC to blink LEDs and advance a binary sequence based on user input pins.

2. **Hungry Hippo LED Game** (`hw2`)
   - Build an interrupt-driven, seven-segment‐scoreboard game where a “hippo” LED climbs to eat a blinking prize on PORTD, with soft and hard resets and score decay.

3. **Parking Lot Simulator** (`hw3`)
   - Create a USART‐based interface between a PIC and a Python simulator to manage multilevel parking operations, subscriptions, and fee calculations with ADC‐based level selection and display toggling.
